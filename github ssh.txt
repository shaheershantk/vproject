Here are the steps I followed to resolve it -

mkdir -p ~/.ssh
ssh-keyscan -t rsa github.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "user.email"
open the public key with this command $ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub and copy it.
Add the id_rsa.pub key to SSH keys list on your GitHub profile.

git remote set-url origin <location>
